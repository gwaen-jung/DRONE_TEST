// compile and upload to board. Shouldn't need to modify other eye code.

#include <Arduino.h>
#include "../Audio/Audio.h"

  Suppose we have a global bool "animating" (meaning something is in
  motion) and global uint32_t's "startTime" (the initial time at which
  something triggered movement) and "transitionTime" (the total time
  over which movement should occur, expressed in microseconds).
  Maybe it's servos, maybe NeoPixels, or something different altogether.
  This function might resemble something like (pseudocode):

  if(!animating) {
    Not in motion, check sensor for trigger...
    if(read some sensor) {
      Motion is triggered! Record startTime, set transition
      to 1.5 seconds and set animating flag:
      startTime      = micros();
      transitionTime = 1500000;
      animating      = true;
      No motion actually takes place yet, that will begin on
      the next pass through this function.
    }
  } else {
    Currently in motion, ignore trigger and move things instead...
    uint32_t elapsed = millis() - startTime;
    if(elapsed < transitionTime) {
      Part way through motion...how far along?
      float ratio = (float)elapsed / (float)transitionTime;
      Do something here based on ratio, 0.0 = start, 1.0 = end
    } else {
      End of motion reached.
      Take whatever steps here to move into final position (1.0),
      and then clear the "animating" flag:
      animating = false;
    }
  }
